This repo contains answers to coding questions and code solution demos written for 
iOS 8 app using Objective-C and Swift.


AnswerStoryBoards is an Objective-C solution that 
demos the use of multiple storyboards.  This demo includes ReverseString 
category which is used to create a mirror image in second storyboard viewcontroller. 
This demo includes Objective-C console log solution to Jeff Atwood's FizzBuzz, 
http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/

Atwood's question:  [Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of 
five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three 
and five print "FizzBuzz".]

My two-minute Objective-C Solution:  

int i;
    for (i=1; i<= 100; i++) {
        
        if (i % 3*5 == 0){
            NSLog(@"FizzBuzz\n");
        }else if (i % 5 == 0){
            NSLog(@"Buzz\n");
        }else if (i % 3 == 0){
            NSLog (@"Fizz\n");
        } //Default
        
        NSLog(@"%i\n",i);
        
    }

App can be run in simulator. Look at debug console for NSLogs.

Swift iOS 8 demo app called "Sepia Tones" which makes calls to Flickr API;
uses UICollectionView; KVO to display UIActivityIndicatorView which spins 
when the photo loads [does not stop spinning]; offers default search value for 
"black and white photos"; enter any search value and all returned photos 
will be Sepia toned; Use cmd+k to show the keyboard in simulator;  The search button on 
the keyboard is disabled; Use Search button on the navigation bar.

Must enter a Flickr API key in FlickrPhotos.swift to run the app in simulator.
