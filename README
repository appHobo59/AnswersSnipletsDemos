This repo contains answers to coding questions and code solution demos written for 
iOS 8 app using Objective-C and Swift.


AnswerStoryBoards is an Objective-C solution that 
demos the use of multiple storyboards.  This demo includes ReverseString 
category which is used to create a mirror image in second storyboard viewcontroller. 


Swift iOS 8 demo app called "Sepia Tones" which makes calls to Flickr API;
uses UICollectionView; KVO to display UIActivityIndicatorView which spins 
when the photo loads [does not stop spinning]; offers default search value for 
"black and white photos"; enter any search value and all returned photos 
will be Sepia toned; Use cmd+k to show the keyboard in simulator;  The search button on 
the keyboard is disabled; Use Search button on the navigation bar.

Must enter a Flickr API key in FlickrPhotos.swift to run the app in simulator.

WordPartsProtocolDemo written in Swift iOS 8 demo of Generic that is
 constrained by Protocol.
 
 Swift playground added to show Big-O notation difference between iterative code solution
 for fibonacci numbers and recursive solution for Fibonacci numbers.  The recursive 
 solution is O(n^2) run time in Big O which is inefficient.
